                <p>Legend has it that about two centuries ago, the southeast portion of the hilly terrain known as the Malabar Hill, where Lord Babulnath’s ancient temple is situated, belonged to one Panduranga, a rich goldsmith. His cattle were grazing around.

                    Being grazing land, there was nothing to be taken care of by Babul, the caretaker of Panduranga’s cattle stock.
                    
                    Once it was noticed that a cow Kapila stopped giving milk. On enquiry, Babul reported that the very cow, before coming home reaches a point and suo-moto puts out all her milk. Babul could not explain the logic behind this, but had made Panduranga inquisitive.
                    
                    The very next day, Panduranga saw the scene again and he was overwhelmed when the said cow, Kapila was repeating her usual act. On reaching there a huge Shivalinga was found. It is the very place where the temple has been built</p>

                <p>Every year millions of devotees visit this magnificent temple. It was built nearly 200 years ago and is one of the most spacious temples in the city. The devotees are undoubtedly proud of its rich and varied heritage.

                    Over the ages many saints across India have sung praises of Lord Shiva. Pushpadanta wrote the Shiva Mahimnah Stotram , as he was a great devotee of Lord Shiva . Even today devotees recite the same Stotram for Lord Shiva Pujan.
                    
                    This temple is located at the end of Marine Drive and south of Malabar Hill, which was built in 1780. Also In 1900, a tall spire was added to this auspicious, original temple of Lord Shiva. A stone Lingam of Lord Shiva is worshipped at Babulnath.
                    
                    The main worship day is Monday. Closest railway to reach temple is Marine Lines (Western Railway)</p>
